# Potato-Yield-Classification-Model
The project proposes a machine learning-based approach that integrates deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image analysis. The dataset (from Kaggle), consisting of images of healthy potato plants, early blight, and late blight, will be used for model training.
