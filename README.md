# Potato-Yield-Classification-Model
The project proposes a machine learning-based approach that integrates deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image analysis. The dataset (from Kaggle), consisting of images of healthy potato plants, early blight, and late blight, will be used for model training.

The pipeline includes preprocessing steps, feature extraction using CNNs, and classification into three categories: late blight, early blight, and healthy plant. The trained model will be incorporated into an application for easy use by farmers. The project serves as an advanced tool for determining the health status of potato crops,
specifically identifying whether they are affected by early blight, late blight, or remain healthy.Users input images of potato plants, and the program employs natural image processing and machine learning, including convolutional neural networks, to discern disease patterns. The output provides a conclusive assessment of the potato's condition, guiding users on whether the crop is defective or healthy for consumption.
